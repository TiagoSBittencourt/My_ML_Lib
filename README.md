## Features

- **Cost Function**: Computes the cost of predictions using mean squared error.
- **Gradient Function**: Calculates the gradients for the model parameters (weight and bias).
- **Gradient Descent**: Optimizes the weight and bias parameters through iterative updates.
- **History Tracking**: Optionally tracks and prints the cost and parameter updates during training.

## Installation

To use this library, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

## Requirements
